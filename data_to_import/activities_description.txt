Grill with friends
Barbecue for friends is an invitation to abandon the rigid uniform and behavior associated with other types of meetings. A barbecue is a nonchalant, casual meeting during which we feel completely at ease. Children like to play football or other games, and adults willingly accompany them. Each grill is a small celebration that brings together family and friends. Our ancestors used to gather in a circle by the fire to talk and listen to stories. Today, it is the grill that becomes the equivalent of the mythical bonfire.
